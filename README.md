# pagure-cli

`pagure-cli` is written in Haskell and currently requires a working Haskell
stack to use. In the near future, a COPR will be made which will allow easier
installation until all of our dependencies are officially packaged.

We are using `stack` for this project. There are Fedora and RHEL/CentOS
repositories provided by the upstream here:
